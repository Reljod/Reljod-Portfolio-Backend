# Key points

Algorithm
- A set of instructions used to solve a particular problem.

Data Structure
- Data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
- Storage of data.

Linear Data structure
- The data are arranged in a sequence.

Popular Linear Data Structures:
1. Array Data Structure
2. Stack Data Structure
3. Queue Data Structure
4. Linked List Data Structure


Non-linear Data Structure
- data are not in sequence
- data are in hierarchical manner where one element can be connected
to one or more elements.

1. Graph Data Structure
2. Trees Data Structure

## Difference between Linear and Non-linear data structure

**Linear:**
- arranged in sequential order.
- all items in single layer.
- all items can be traversed by a single run.
- memory utilization is not efficient.
- time complexity increases with Data size.

**Non-linear:**
- arranged in non-sequential order.
- data items are present in different layers. 
- it takes multiple runs to traverse all data.
- more memory efficient.
- time complexity remains the same.


Linearly scalable Algorithms
- Algorithms that growth linearly in time when the linear growth of data.

Constant Time Algorithms
- The time doesn't grow with increasing size or data.


## Asymptotic Analysis
The study of change in performance of an algorithm with the change of the input size.

Asymptotic Notation
- mathematical notation used to describe the running time of an algorithm.

Big-O Notation
- worst case complexity of an algorithm or upper bound.

Omega Notation
- best case complexity or lower bound.

Theta Notation
- represents both lower and upper bound.
- analyzing average-case complexity.
